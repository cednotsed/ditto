Investigating patterns of SARS-CoV-2 host adaptation following human-to-animal transmission.

* We initially analysed the presence of recurrent mutations (homoplasies) from mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 sequences in late 2020. This work was associated with a BioRXIV [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.384743v1). 
* Following reports of human-to-deer transmission in the USA, we re-analysed deer and mink sequences to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the extent of animal-specific adaptation.
